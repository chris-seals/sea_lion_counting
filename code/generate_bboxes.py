# Generate bounding boxes around the sea lions in the dotted images
# These boxes are turned into image files and saved off in a folder structure

# import os.path
# if os.path.exists('../results/bbox_chips/adult_males'):
#     print(True)

# Identify filenames
# Identify location of dotted images
# Identify location of unmarked images

# Extract dot locations
# Create locations of sea lions
# Iterate through the locations, extract bounding box by type of sea lion
# 1. check for directory existence
# 2. if not existing, create it
# 3. save off chip for each bbox, and write chip path
